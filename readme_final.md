# Robo Advisor Lite

## Project Overview

This tool gives an overview of some trends in the stock market, within varying sectors, and allows the user to choose up to five stocks to be analysed using data from Yahoo Finance. The analysis provides five years of the stocks' price movement in a graph, along with general information and some current important financial values. Two Monte Carlo Simulations will be provided as apart of the analysis: one with user-provided weights and another with calculated ideal weights. Both simulations' data will be shown to the user so they are able to make the best decision.
